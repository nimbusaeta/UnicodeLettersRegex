# Unicode Letters Regex
## Hello!
I'm a corpus linguist who often deals with texts with special characters standing in for letters. Aside from not being accessible for screen readers, they wreck my analysis because "Hello" and "ùìóello" are different words from the computer's point of view.

While there are a couple sites out there that will clean specific lines, I'm dealing with huge files and I needed to automate it. Enter some unelegant regexes. My unscientific approach was going to several "fancy font" generators and compiling all the fonts into one document, so I'm sure I'm missing some not-actually-letters here. I'm sure it's non-exhaustive, so please add away if you find characters I missed.

## Setup etc
**Run in Python 3 or above**, otherwise (ironically?) Python won't be able to deal with the non-ASCII characters. This is set up with relative paths, so you can either put the .txt documents to clean in the "Directory" directory or write in your own path.

Since I already had an iterator script to clean all documents in a directory, I cleaned it up a bit and tossed it here too.

## "Fonts" in RegEx
unicodeletters.txt includes all the characters in the regex, sorted by letter rather than by "font." The "fonts" included are below; again, this is probably non-exhaustive and I welcome additions. The letters excluded aren't my doing, [they were requested over a decade ago](https://unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4068.pdf) but are still not encoded.
